When we arrived late at night, they had given us 3 x rooms of around 15sqm each with one double bed in each room and had no more rooms to assist us. As it was late at night we had no option but to take the rooms and have some adults share a bed and other adults sleep on the floor (that were not comfortable with sharing a small bed, or against their culture). The next day we left the guest house, as they could not give us the rooms that we had originally booked due to being at full capacity and over booking their rooms. Therefore we contacted booking.com, and booking.com told us they would refund us, as their policy is either an equivalent room or better (which we did not get). Since then booking.com has used every excuse not to refund us, with their latest argument being that the amount we payed was a value in Rands but our bank statement (yes we had to send our bank statement proving we paid the guest house) shows a value in Meticais. seeing as we from Mozambique our local currency is meticais and when our bank charges us it is in meticais. But this is very common as wherever one travels in the world they can pay on a card machine any currency, and then the clients bank will convert that currency into their local currency on the spot rate plus whatever the bank charges. Booking.com has told me I am the first person this has happened to?? They even asked us to get a stamped letter from our bank, for our bank to state what amount entered the bank in ZAR (South African currency), and what exchange rate they used to translate to the value showing on my bank statement in Meticais. After much talk with our bank we managed to get this, now booking.com has told us they unfortunately cannot assist, as our bank should of charged us in Rands (ZAR), and our bank statement should show the Rands amount, which is impossible. Therefore we had to just accept the 7,480.00 ZAR the guest house and booking.com basically stole from us. . I told booking.com they should have a disclaimer stating they don't recognize certain currencies from certain countries, and their hosts should not accept cards from certain foreign countries then.

178,33,marco p,1,ZA,1,I booked a guest house in South Africa…,"I booked a guest house in South Africa through booking.com in December 2020. When myself and my team arrived, it was not what we had booked, we were a team of 6 adult men on a company conference trip, therefore we booked three rooms of 100sqm (supposed to be huge) with two double beds inside each room. When we arrived late at night, they had given us 3 x rooms of around 15sqm each with one double bed in each room and had no more rooms to assist us. As it was late at night we had no option but to take the rooms and have some adults share a bed and other adults sleep on the floor (that were not comfortable with sharing a small bed, or against their culture). The next day we left the guest house, as they could not give us the rooms that we had originally booked due to being at full capacity and over booking their rooms. Therefore we contacted booking.com, and booking.com told us they would refund us, as their policy is either an equivalent room or better (which we did not get). Since then booking.com has used every excuse not to refund us, with their latest argument being that the amount we payed was a value in Rands but our bank statement (yes we had to send our bank statement proving we paid the guest house) shows a value in Meticais. seeing as we from Mozambique our local currency is meticais and when our bank charges us it is in meticais.

Neither booking.com nor the hotel will answer emails or phone calls no matter how many times and who you contact and you end up just frustrated and your money is tied up. Very very disappointed will never use it again. and unfortunately Red Lion was just as rude they told me if you put that online too bad there's nothing they can do about it. Then why use a online booking service if you can't keep your customers happy. I was quoted 288 by booking.com they said no charge would be made and it was free cancellation I tried to cancel within an hour (after falling down stairs and taken to er) and first was told there was a 134 charge and then there was no cancellation...but the hotel immediately charged me $333. What booking.com set up was my arrival between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and I actually wrote eight to 9:00 p.m. and my reservation wasn't made till 5:00 p.m. . When they do this it already books you into the hotel and you can't cancel so it's kind of a scam. Be warned and the hotel will do nothing it's out of their hands they claim. So from what I understand is booking.com overrides the hotel's ability to revise or change or cancel a reservation.

363,61,Kim Fox,3,US,1,Don’t give your card number to Bookkng,"I made a reservation at a hotel in Utah and was unable to check in due to illness. At the time I made the reservation, Booking insisted on a credit card to hold the reservation and stated that I would not be charged until I checked into the hotel. This was during Covid restrictions with hotels full of rooms. I could’ve just driven up to any hotel at that point and gotten any number of rooms.

Don't expect service and don't expect your money back. Never cancel your ticket than your hard earnings will be lost.

685,32,Kleuzi,5,NL,1,Don't use this service,"Don't use this service. They have totally disconnected themselves from their customers. My wife was stranded in Seattle as there was a ticketing change. When we got to the airport the new airlines said they had no record of her first connectin flight only her 2nd and 3rd. We tried the main airlines that the trip was managed by but they couldn't help us because CheapTickets.nl was the only ones that could. They were able to see that the change in flights resulted in no ticket booked for the first leg but all other flights were fine. After standing there trying to call and using the online message service we couldn't reach anyone. The airline check-in agent said the counter was closing so he couldn't get her on the flight any longer. At that point, an agent from CheapTicket.nl finally answered our message and said he had a booking but it was already too late. So the only other option was to buy a ticket for the next flight out so she could get her connecting flight.

716,36,Polly Smith,3,GB,1,Don’t touch this company even if your…,"Don’t touch this company even if your life depended on it!!. . I had flight booked to Iceland through one of their companies, Budgetair, on 14th February which were cancelled due to bad weather. Firstly they didn’t inform us the flight has been cancelled we heard from a friend who was also travelling and wisely booked directly with Icelandair.. . So there begins the debarcle of trying to get our money back. When they did deposit d to emails it was that they were waiting for Icelandair to refund to them before refund To me. Then they blamed the Covid crisis when my flights were cancelled before the pandemic took full hold.. . Finally I contacted Icelandair direct and they told me they had refund my money to Fudgeitair in June/July . . I contacted Couldn’tcareair and they said they refunded me on 9th July... but it takes a while to come through the bank ... surely not 6 weeks though . .

The courier that brought the package just left the item unattended in front of a door of who knows who. I am wondering how little this service is reliable, since even though I made a mistake and I recognized it I then asked Bol.com or the supplier to find a solution to the issue, since it is pretty weird that an Item is left in front of a door without no one to withdraw it.

1142,44,tve,2,NL,1,Seriously disappointed in their service.,"Ordered a refrigerator from bol.com. First, the delivery service PostNL doesn't want to take the old refrigerator, even though bol.com promises this on their site. Called bol.com, they will pick up tomorrow. Okay, so far. Then, as I unpack the new one, it turns out the door is severely damaged. Called Bol.com again. They don't give me money back, but only giftcards (I exchanged another non-bol.com giftcard for these, to buy this refrigerator - now I'm apparently stuck with bol). I cannot get a replacement and have to order again (...) and let them take this damaged one, next week (it's Thursday now). And then, maybe, the whole cycle starts again. Let's see. So far I am seriously disappointed in their service.. . Update 1, 20210130: And OF COURSE they're going to send it via PostNL, so AGAIN they won't take my old fridge. PLUS a big chance the thing arrives damaged yet AGAIN.. . Update 2, 20210130: NOT delivering today. I'll have to wait till Tuesday. Put the old fridge back for now then. (Of course then I can defrost and clean the thing all over again before pickup... whenever that is going to be.) Also already planned with them for a pickup of the old fridge on Wednesday, because they're definitely going through PostNL again, and won't pickup my old fridge when they drop off the (hopefully not again damaged) new one.. . Update 3, 20210131: Hm... Bol.com contacting me 'as soon as possible' based on my review apparently doesn't mean 'at least within 3 days after we said that'.. . Update 4, 20210201: PostNL guy comes up to the house holding the new fridge by the bands around the box. Needles to say, this one's damaged as well. Again, I'm calling with bol.com. NOW all of a sudden it IS possible to replace the damaged machine. They'll call me to arrange delivery (again, via PostNL) and pickup of the broken second fridge. (Third time's a charm? I won't get my hopes up.). . 20210204, last update: Fridge #3 also damaged at arrival. I give up. Last thing they're going to try for me is putting my money on my bank account, instead of back on the gift cards that are registered with them.. . One more update on this: in the end they could not give me the money back, because of the risk of 'money laundering', so I HAD to order again from them. This time I ordered from a third party.

So far I am seriously disappointed in their service.. . Update 1, 20210130: And OF COURSE they're going to send it via PostNL, so AGAIN they won't take my old fridge. PLUS a big chance the thing arrives damaged yet AGAIN.. . Update 2, 20210130: NOT delivering today. I'll have to wait till Tuesday. Put the old fridge back for now then. (Of course then I can defrost and clean the thing all over again before pickup... whenever that is going to be.) Also already planned with them for a pickup of the old fridge on Wednesday, because they're definitely going through PostNL again, and won't pickup my old fridge when they drop off the (hopefully not again damaged) new one.. . Update 3, 20210131: Hm... Bol.com contacting me 'as soon as possible' based on my review apparently doesn't mean 'at least within 3 days after we said that'.. . Update 4, 20210201: PostNL guy comes up to the house holding the new fridge by the bands around the box. Needles to say, this one's damaged as well. Again, I'm calling with bol.com. NOW all of a sudden it IS possible to replace the damaged machine. They'll call me to arrange delivery (again, via PostNL) and pickup of the broken second fridge. (Third time's a charm? I won't get my hopes up.). . 20210204, last update: Fridge #3 also damaged at arrival. I give up. Last thing they're going to try for me is putting my money on my bank account, instead of back on the gift cards that are registered with them.. . One more update on this: in the end they could not give me the money back, because of the risk of 'money laundering', so I HAD to order again from them. This time I ordered from a third party. Everything went well.. . Oh, and 'Chantal' never contacted me.

First, the delivery service PostNL doesn't want to take the old refrigerator, even though bol.com promises this on their site. Called bol.com, they will pick up tomorrow. Okay, so far.

1384,93,Alejandra Tejera,1,BE,1,BOL.COM has just lost a very active…,"BOL.COM has just lost a very active buyer. . . I called their client service to complain that the ‘pick-up’ shop where my parcel had been delivered to not only had not given it to me, but that i got verbally abused. They claimed they did not have my package in their shop even though i double checked later on with Dpd and they confirmed this. The shop was in extreme disorder, so logically they did not find the parcel under a mountain of other parcels. Instead of owning up to it, they got defensive and extremely abusive. I called bol.com to complain about the ‘missing’ parcel and the only solution they had to offer was, and I quote: ‘to go back to the shop and implore them to give me my parcel back’. The first time around i got verbally abused by the owner, so, logically, it is up to me to ‘implore’ to this, for lack for a better expression, ‘woman-beater’ so that i get physically hurt. Not an apology or a ‘we will reimburse you’. This person from the ‘klantenservice’ went as far as saying that i could be lying and that the version of the shop owner had to be heard. Really? As much as such a high level of fairness and acute sense of justice is commendable, he is directing it towards someone who not only is not a customer, but has abused the latter.

I called their client service to complain that the ‘pick-up’ shop where my parcel had been delivered to not only had not given it to me, but that i got verbally abused. They claimed they did not have my package in their shop even though i double checked later on with Dpd and they confirmed this. The shop was in extreme disorder, so logically they did not find the parcel under a mountain of other parcels. Instead of owning up to it, they got defensive and extremely abusive. I called bol.com to complain about the ‘missing’ parcel and the only solution they had to offer was, and I quote: ‘to go back to the shop and implore them to give me my parcel back’. The first time around i got verbally abused by the owner, so, logically, it is up to me to ‘implore’ to this, for lack for a better expression, ‘woman-beater’ so that i get physically hurt.

I received an email, but the one i should’ve gotten with the lable i needed to print out didn’t come, so i emailed back and then i got it finally. 19th of February we’ve send my expensive laptop through the mail back to them to let them repare it, as they should because it has 2 years guarantee.

Even calling took me three times because they take ages before picking up the phone. Something had went wrong in their administration.

I need a good functioning laptop.

1628,77,Lotte Fritzsch,2,NL,1,Super bad service,"Super bad service. July 2020 i bought a HP Pavilion x360 from them, it only took like one or two months before it started getting problems. After having to call three times before getting a hold of them, they gave me one solution; they’d send me a mail with retour instructions. I received an email, but the one i should’ve gotten with the lable i needed to print out didn’t come, so i emailed back and then i got it finally. 19th of February we’ve send my expensive laptop through the mail back to them to let them repare it, as they should because it has 2 years guarantee. After not hearing from them for a week I was like why didn’t i get a confirmation that they’ve received it. So i called. Even calling took me three times because they take ages before picking up the phone. Something had went wrong in their administration. They told me they had to do research about why they didn’t have it in their system yet. 5 workdays more waiting! It’s my laptop that i use and need for my school work. Im in college.

When I contacted customer service, I was surprised to see that not only they were not able to give me a reason that my order will not arrive, but they also didnt initiate immedialtely my refund, as the products had to be found first! My refund was completed a month later in two parts, although none of my actions were related to this problem. On the top of this inconvenience, as an English speaker, my communication to customer service has been in English, however their replies have been in Dutch, which I find particularly rude. Last, their customer service chat app, that I had to download, was not working properly within their communicated working hours, which also created unnecessary inconvenience to me.

When I contacted customer service, I was surprised to see that not only they were not able to give me a reason that my order will not arrive, but they also didnt initiate immedialtely my refund, as the products had to be found first! My refund was completed a month later in two parts, although none of my actions were related to this problem. On the top of this inconvenience, as an English speaker, my communication to customer service has been in English, however their replies have been in Dutch, which I find particularly rude. Last, their customer service chat app, that I had to download, was not working properly within their communicated working hours, which also created unnecessary inconvenience to me.

1836,29,Marian,5,NL,1,I thought I was a loyal customer...,"So I have been a customer now 7 years of Wehkamp and I have no open invoices. Always paid them full. I have been using the service ‘ achteraf betalen (like after pay)’ since I got to know of it. I thought it was brilliant! Because this service made me go on like a shopping spree whenever I felt like it, or needed something last minute. But just like ‘normal shopping’, the clothes don’t always fit like you hoped/imagine it would. So I also make use of the return service but always kept something and paid for it. Like I said no open invoices. Little did I know that the combination of ‘achteraf betalen’ and so many returns would lead to me now not having the option ‘achteraf betalen’ anymore. Don’t get me wrong, I understand that there are processes to maintain. But the fact that I didn’t get an email or message upfront about this, where as in the conditions it says I would, I find this very bad customer service. And also while I wanted to place my order and at the step of choosing ‘my’ payment option it said ‘Iets is mis gegaan met jouw betaling..probeer het opnieuw’. So I kept trying 2 days in a row. So decided to call customer service. The ladies were polite, but they couldn’t help me. They could just explain me the why and pass on my feedback. I mean come on Wehkamp ..at least send me a personal message why I cannot longer make use if the service..... . Update 10-12-2020.

1861,31,Ursula Bugmann,1,NL,1,I just called to your customer service…,"I just called to your customer service and was ""helped"" by a very impolite lady who yelled at me and did not even try to listen to my concern. The call was at 16:52 and was 15 minutes and 57 seconds long. If calls are recorded, please check it.. . For the second time I got the pick up appointment cancelled by no reason. The carrier claimed that I did not open the door, but I have been home the whole day to make sure I do not miss it and the bell has not been rung. Not even once. I live in a studio apartment so it is quite impossible to miss such a loud bell in such a small place.. . Now I have a new appointment for tomorrow. Do I need to hope on not getting it cancelled for the 3rd time or will the carrier actually ring my bell and pick up the item??.

I am disappointed with the services especially their delivery. The delivery person refused to bring my package to my door, and instead asked me to come down to our apartment building door to get my package. He said that my package was big and he would like me to get it and bring it upstairs myself. Lol. He’s suppose to deliver in my address, our building door is not my address. And to add up to my annoyance, is how he took care of my order. It was covered with mud and its really annoying that some mud came in the plastic and to the carpet i ordered. He just dragged it on the dirty muddy ground like he doesnt care! How lazy! Now my carpet is dirty. Its new and it is very nice but its dirty. Its a 100€ carpet and he just trashed it like that! I dont know well about your company but if you have bad delivery service like that it will drag your name down the drain. I rate my experience with wehkamp to one star. . .

1927,41,Weiyang Zhu,1,NL,1,I feel very disappointing,"I feel very disappointing about wehkamp's service. . I placed an order on Nov 23 because of the Black Friday action. It is not an action by wehkamp but by the miele official website. So if I purchase certain product between Nov 23 and Nov 25 from their retailer I can get cash back from miele.. However there is some problem with the delivery. I called the customers service several times and finally we found the product is back to the stock. So I placed the order again, and the wehkamp promised that they will make sure that the order proof would be on Nov 23.. But when I finally received the product on Dec 3 I found that the invoice is still not correct. I called them again and the lady said her colleague will send me the correct invoice with correct date by email.. another day, I received the email from Wehkamp, they said there was no action by miele. I sent them the screen shot of the action but I received another email, they just ignore my screen shot and said it is not the product I ordered. I was so angry because the mechine type was clearly stated in my screen shot and I have highlighted it. . I asked them to check it again and I have not received any reply since that..... It is a long story but I feel real angry and helpless. I think the customers service is not friendly nor professional.

1943,41,Weiyang Zhu,1,NL,1,I feel very disappointing,"I feel very disappointing about wehkamp's service. . I placed an order on Nov 23 because of the Black Friday action. It is not an action by wehkamp but by the miele official website. So if I purchase certain product between Nov 23 and Nov 25 from their retailer I can get cash back from miele.. However there is some problem with the delivery. I called the customers service several times and finally we found the product is back to the stock. So I placed the order again, and the wehkamp promised that they will make sure that the order proof would be on Nov 23.. But when I finally received the product on Dec 3 I found that the invoice is still not correct. I called them again and the lady said her colleague will send me the correct invoice with correct date by email.. another day, I received the email from Wehkamp, they said there was no action by miele. I sent them the screen shot of the action but I received another email, they just ignore my screen shot and said it is not the product I ordered. I was so angry because the mechine type was clearly stated in my screen shot and I have highlighted it. . I asked them to check it again and I have not received any reply since that..... It is a long story but I feel real angry and helpless. I think the customers service is not friendly nor professional.

2001,54,Marta Bulgajewska,2,NL,1,The worst customer care ever....,I think you have the worst customer care I have ever experienced.

2023,63,Danielly,1,NL,1,My order didn't arrive and they don't even care,"I ordered a bed at wehkamp.nl and the first problem appeared when I received an email telling they didn't have the product in stock (even the website saying they had) and I would have an one week delay in my delivery. I accepted, since I was buying the bed for my mother and she would arrive 3 weeks later. The bed delivery was scheduled to 04/08 between 9:45 and 11:45. I waited all day at home and nothing.. . I contacted Wehkamp and then I got nothing than excuses for one week, telling they were contacting PostNL Extra@Home to know what happened and asking them to call me to solve the situation. Tired of waiting and almost beg to know why I wasn't receiving any call or some solution, I called Extra@Home by myself and surprise: they had to cancel my delivery because Wehkamp didn't send them my full order. It should be 3 pieces, but they just got 2 and since 04/08 they are waiting to receive the missing piece from Wehkamp.. . I contacted Wehkamp again telling what I discovered and the answer was ""that's a pity"" and that the back office would investigate. I talk with Wehkamp every single day and they are unable to give me some estimative to solve my problem. My mother will arrive very soon with no bed and all Wehkamp do is give me excuses, not a deadline.. . All the answers are very vague. And they already lied in my first contact when they told it was Extra@Home fault. Looks like they're doing nothing to solve this problem and I just want to have the product I already paid for and they committed to deliver at 04/08.. . I need a deadline, I need a solution. Wehkamp refuses to give me that and just say they're investigating and trying to discover what happened. Honestly I don't care what happened anymore, I just want my order so my mother will have a bed. I don't have time to buy another one and wait the deliver, I don't have another week.. . This experience is terrible and I would not recommend Wehkamp to anyone. The store is amazing until something happen and you need the customer service. They just don't seem to care or even do something about the problem.. . Update 11/08, 4:22pm: Wehkamp just called me and scheduled a new delivery for tomorrow. They will re-order the bed for me.

I accepted, since I was buying the bed for my mother and she would arrive 3 weeks later. The bed delivery was scheduled to 04/08 between 9:45 and 11:45. I waited all day at home and nothing.. . I contacted Wehkamp and then I got nothing than excuses for one week, telling they were contacting PostNL Extra@Home to know what happened and asking them to call me to solve the situation. Tired of waiting and almost beg to know why I wasn't receiving any call or some solution, I called Extra@Home by myself and surprise: they had to cancel my delivery because Wehkamp didn't send them my full order. It should be 3 pieces, but they just got 2 and since 04/08 they are waiting to receive the missing piece from Wehkamp.. . I contacted Wehkamp again telling what I discovered and the answer was ""that's a pity"" and that the back office would investigate. I talk with Wehkamp every single day and they are unable to give me some estimative to solve my problem. My mother will arrive very soon with no bed and all Wehkamp do is give me excuses, not a deadline.. . All the answers are very vague. And they already lied in my first contact when they told it was Extra@Home fault. Looks like they're doing nothing to solve this problem and I just want to have the product I already paid for and they committed to deliver at 04/08.. . I need a deadline, I need a solution. Wehkamp refuses to give me that and just say they're investigating and trying to discover what happened. Honestly I don't care what happened anymore, I just want my order so my mother will have a bed. I don't have time to buy another one and wait the deliver, I don't have another week.. . This experience is terrible and I would not recommend Wehkamp to anyone. The store is amazing until something happen and you need the customer service. They just don't seem to care or even do something about the problem.. . Update 11/08, 4:22pm: Wehkamp just called me and scheduled a new delivery for tomorrow. They will re-order the bed for me.

2078,71,R,1,NL,1,"Dishonest, broken payment and delivery system- still waiting for a delivery for over 2 weeks","I made an order with this site - wehkamp  (which claims voor 23:30 is besteled, is morgen in huis) on 14 Dec 2014. I expected part of the order which was in stock the next day, but nothing happened. After couple of days I got an emial from finance saying I havent paid - which I had. I spend 20 min connecting to support who told all is okay and I will the get the delivery the next day - I skipped office waiting for the furniture - still nothing!!! I gave up calling support after waiting for over 15 min in queue. Finally I got an email last week giving me option to select a delivery time. I called support to make sure they are delivering to the Bezorg adress (delivery address) and not to the billing address. They could make no guarentees!! Again waited on the selcted date and time with no furniture!!! . . I was planning to setup my new house before newyear in time for my fmaily's return from holidays and Wehkamp has ruined it with their inefficeincy and dishonesty. There is no connenctions with their claims on the webpage and actual execution. The support has no idea what operations and finance are doing, they cant distinguish between billing and delivery address, zero responsibility towards their claims.",2015-01-03 09:16:56+00:00,1,2015-01-04 12:59:13+00:00,"Hi R, we'd like to have a look about what is going wrong with your order.

They only deliver where there is no option to choose day/ not being home/deliver to neighbours. My package stayed for two weeks next to the entrance of my building.  Chat function is not working, facebook chat refers to call their number which makes zero sense and costs more to zalando itself. Please do something about, I hate where the site is going towards!",2020-10-06 09:56:59+00:00,0,,-,zalando.nl,"Please do something about, I hate where the site is going towards!"

I took it upon myself to look where the shoes were and they were left at the post office in Germany. I contacted your team and was told that you could not retrieve them from the post office.

2610,0,Leo Watson,1,NL,1,Terrible customer service,I ordered a product from mediamarkt on the 11/12/2020 and to this day the product is yet to arrive. Whilst this is not completely the fault of mediamarkt and actually postnl themselves I was still shocked at the customer service I received and having to wait almost 2 months to get my money back and only due to the fact that I called and emailed multiple times. What frustrated me was that when I called after the parcel having quite obviously lost in the post I was told that  the packet will actually arrive on the day I called however the customer support lady clearly knew this was a lie. I was also told by email after having waited a week for an answer that I should have received my package according to them when it still was no where to be seen.. .

When I asked to pay monthly I was told it is possible by the contact service, but when I went in store (Antwerp) to sign the paperwork, I was told that I should at least speak one of the national languages to sign (while fulfilling all the requirements). . . I suggested the option to circumvent this issue by me translating the original document and reading it myself, while signing it in the current language (knowing what it says I could sign any document in any language). They rudely declined in person and normally declined by email without even discussing a case that would cost the company 3-4K (with monthly payments this would have gone even higher or even considering future purchases etc.).. .

No complaints about the washing machine, it came a couple of days later fine. But then we realised that the connection to the pipes and tubes of the washing machine is on the 3rd floor of our townhouse and it's too heavy even to drag it on the floor. So we decided to go to the store and order the installation of it, which is available when you order it online, but it's much harder to get it after you already received the item. So we came through several circles of hell. First we went to the service department, the girl said it's impossible to get the installation, then we came to the man in the department of the washing machines in the store and he said ok, i'll do the apointment. We paid 20 euros for it, waited till the date he said they will come. Nobody came. Went back to the store to know what's wrong, he said they will call on Monday. Nobody called. Went back to store, they said in the customer department there is no appointment even created. And he created for us an appointment for installation. No confirmation on email, no calls, nobody came.

The call was dropped from the queue twice after waiting for 20-30 minutes. Worst of all I was promised twice that my problem is going to be resolved and my first order is going to be re-delivered for me. In the end I just got refunded (and still waiting for the money back from the first order). I got no response from facebook or twitter communication channels. This was simply the worst ever experience of retail shopping for me. So I had to buy the same washing mashing again(!). Second time lucky the delivery team worked as expected.",2020-11-25 14:09:51+00:00,0,,-,mediamarkt.nl,Second time lucky the delivery team worked as expected.

I called an official Samsung service, they came to my house and agreed that it has to be changed. I called Mediamarkt, arranged a return because they did not have the same model in their warehouse at that moment. So I decided to have my money back. Mediamarkt also told me that the vacuum cleaner was a gift coming together with the fridge, so I have to return it together with the fridge. I agreed and packed it up as they told me and handed it over to the same guy who got the fridge myself.. . After a few days, I had around 1000 euros back in my account. It was exact same amount written for the fridge on the invoce. So, I figured they returned the money for the fridge but the vacuum cleaner. I called Mediamarkt right away and told them I also returned the vacuum cleaner as they told me. First, they told me it was their mistake, they initiated the process and the rest of the money will be in my account within 3 working days. After 3 days I had nothing! (suprise!) Then, I called them again and sent them emails over and over again for 2 months. Answer was always the same: they are working on it. And today, after 2 months, they told me that there is no vacuum cleaner in their warehouse, they talked to the driver who took the fridge and he told them he did not get any vacuum cleaner, he only got the fridge!. . Now I am in a position that looks like I am lying to them! I do not know if it is lost or stolen but I am pretty sure that I gave the vacuum cleaner to the guy. Name of the driver and the exact date of the delivery is written in their system but they cannot do anything about it but saying they are sorry.. . This is a SCAM! Mediamarkt lost a vacuum cleaner worths around 400 euros and make me pay for their mistake!",2020-09-23 18:38:19+00:00,0,,-,mediamarkt.nl,Mediamarkt lost a vacuum cleaner worths around 400 euros and make me pay for their mistake!

3213,6,Diego Campos,5,NL,1,"Extremely disappointed, don’t buy","Extremely disappointed with their customer service and the quality of their website. I bought a Mn Aesop hand soap which is €30, so not a cheap hand soap, normally I buy it from the Aesop website, but this time I gave Bijenkorf  a try.

For such a large corporation I am shocked at how utterly terrible the customer service and cancelation policies are. I am a student and wanted to buy my Christmas presents early this year due to the black Friday. I unfortunately ordered it to my old address in the old city I used to live. I realised my mistake 1 minute later and straight away contacted the customer service and requested my package to be cancelled as I read on your website that orders can be cancelled within 15 minutes after ordering. Your employee at the customer service then confirmed that the order was cancelled and told me ""not to worry"" and that I ""will receive a confirmation email shortly"" and even went to far as to specify that I will receive my money back within 60 days. With this in mind I reorder to my current correct address. The next day after refreshing multiply times I realized that I still haven’t received my confirmation email. I then recontact the customer service and ask why I have not been sent my confirmation email to which I was told “no the employee last night was just looking into cancelling your order”. Not only was I mislead by your employee the first time around by her straight up telling me lies, I am then told that I was wrong to assume that “don’t worry it is cancelled” meant that she had in fact cancelled it. After further inquiring the. employee admitted that the mistake was from there side and that the order was not processed because “there was no one in the office” and apologised and wished me luck. She then said that we could change the address to a dhl pickup point. But it is not possible to change it to a different dhl pickup point in a different city which was why I had requested to cancel in the first place! Either your employees are incompetent and don’t know basic English or she never actually processed my cancellation request and is diverting blame by accusing me of misunderstanding her at the time. I am beyond frustrated as I know have 2 exact same orders, I am down €150 (So most likely will not have enough money to buy Christmas presents for the rest of my family) and now have to figure out how to change the address of my first order to a DHL pick up point in a city that I live 3.5 hrs away from. This all could have been avoided if either you employees do their job and cancel my order (as I requested it well within 15 minutes) or that they communicate clearly that they were not able to do their job (as at least this would have saved me from ordering my items twice).

For such a large corporation I am shocked at how utterly terrible the customer service and cancelation policies are. I am a student and wanted to buy my Christmas presents early this year due to the black Friday. I unfortunately ordered it to my old address in the old city I used to live. I realised my mistake 1 minute later and straight away contacted the customer service and requested my package to be cancelled as I read on your website that orders can be cancelled within 15 minutes after ordering. Your employee at the customer service then confirmed that the order was cancelled and told me ""not to worry"" and that I ""will receive a confirmation email shortly"" and even went to far as to specify that I will receive my money back within 60 days. With this in mind I reorder to my current correct address. The next day after refreshing multiply times I realized that I still haven’t received my confirmation email. I then recontact the customer service and ask why I have not been sent my confirmation email to which I was told “no the employee last night was just looking into cancelling your order”. Not only was I mislead by your employee the first time around by her straight up telling me lies, I am then told that I was wrong to assume that “don’t worry it is cancelled” meant that she had in fact cancelled it. After further inquiring the. employee admitted that the mistake was from there side and that the order was not processed because “there was no one in the office” and apologised and wished me luck. She then said that we could change the address to a dhl pickup point. But it is not possible to change it to a different dhl pickup point in a different city which was why I had requested to cancel in the first place! Either your employees are incompetent and don’t know basic English or she never actually processed my cancellation request and is diverting blame by accusing me of misunderstanding her at the time. I am beyond frustrated as I know have 2 exact same orders, I am down €150 (So most likely will not have enough money to buy Christmas presents for the rest of my family) and now have to figure out how to change the address of my first order to a DHL pick up point in a city that I live 3.5 hrs away from.

3323,26,Tom,5,NL,2,Champagne prices with lemonade service,"On 04/11/2020 at 11:53am, I made several small purchases to the amount of 103,85 from De Bijenkorf in Dam Square. One of those items was a Magisso magnetic cloth holder at a cost of 44,95. I attempted to install the holder on my ceramic sink, but it did not work. The packaging did not mention that the product does not work on ceramic surfaces.. . I decided to return the item to the homewares section of De Bijenkorf in Dam Square, but was not refunded as the manager and clerks decided the item was ‘used’. . . This was a service failure all round for the following reasons: . . Problem #1: Did not receive a receipt for original purchase. . . On 04/11, the sales clerk (from the original sale) took my email address and said I would receive an email with the receipt. This did not arrive, so I had to waste time going to customer services to ask for a printout of the original receipt. . . Problem #2: Wasted customers time. . . On 11/11, the sales clerk (to whom I was returning the faulty item) told me that the receipt would be in the Bijenkorf App. He told me to download the app. I downloaded it, and the purchase was not listed there. He said that he would need to ask his manager what to do, then disappeared with the item. . . Problem #3: Customer stands around with no explanation and then has to go somewhere else for help. . . After waiting for 15 minutes, another clerk advised me to go to Customer Services on the 5th floor to get a printout of the receipt. . . Problem #4: Manager did not listen to my concerns. . . The sales clerk, customer service agent and a store manager showed up at the Customer Service desk. The manager explained that his sales clerk told him that the item was used and could not be refunded. I explained that *you have to remove the adhesive label in order to install the product* and there was no mention of this item not working on specific surfaces on the packaging. He said that you have to assume some level of responsibility for finding this out yourself. He did not accept my explanation and said that the item could not be resold and had to be thrown away. But he decided to issue a 25-euro gift card for my trouble was final.. . Outcome: 30 minutes to resolve, 15 minutes of keeping the customer waiting without explanation. A 25-euro conciliatory gift card on a 44.95 purchase. 19.95 out of pocket for a faulty item, all because of a piece of paper that was removed from an adhesive label (which had to be removed in order to attempt to install the freaking product!). . . In summary, I found this to be:. . - Inefficient and time-consuming.. - A very dogmatic reading of what constitutes a ‘used product’ when the fault lies with the product itself and the lack of explanation on the packaging. . - Embarrassing: I did not enjoy having to explain myself to 3 different people and leave the store feeling like I’d just stood in front of the Spanish Inquisition. . . I have shopped at for Christmas gifts and homewares at De Bijenkorf for 10 years and spent thousands of euros there. After this experience, I will never shop here again. . .

One of those items was a Magisso magnetic cloth holder at a cost of 44,95. I attempted to install the holder on my ceramic sink, but it did not work. The packaging did not mention that the product does not work on ceramic surfaces.. . I decided to return the item to the homewares section of De Bijenkorf in Dam Square, but was not refunded as the manager and clerks decided the item was ‘used’. . . This was a service failure all round for the following reasons: . . Problem #1: Did not receive a receipt for original purchase. . . On 04/11, the sales clerk (from the original sale) took my email address and said I would receive an email with the receipt. This did not arrive, so I had to waste time going to customer services to ask for a printout of the original receipt. . . Problem #2: Wasted customers time. . . On 11/11, the sales clerk (to whom I was returning the faulty item) told me that the receipt would be in the Bijenkorf App. He told me to download the app. I downloaded it, and the purchase was not listed there. He said that he would need to ask his manager what to do, then disappeared with the item. . . Problem #3: Customer stands around with no explanation and then has to go somewhere else for help. . . After waiting for 15 minutes, another clerk advised me to go to Customer Services on the 5th floor to get a printout of the receipt. . . Problem #4: Manager did not listen to my concerns. . . The sales clerk, customer service agent and a store manager showed up at the Customer Service desk. The manager explained that his sales clerk told him that the item was used and could not be refunded. I explained that *you have to remove the adhesive label in order to install the product* and there was no mention of this item not working on specific surfaces on the packaging. He said that you have to assume some level of responsibility for finding this out yourself. He did not accept my explanation and said that the item could not be resold and had to be thrown away.

One of those items was a Magisso magnetic cloth holder at a cost of 44,95. I attempted to install the holder on my ceramic sink, but it did not work. The packaging did not mention that the product does not work on ceramic surfaces.. . I decided to return the item to the homewares section of De Bijenkorf in Dam Square, but was not refunded as the manager and clerks decided the item was ‘used’. . . This was a service failure all round for the following reasons: . . Problem #1: Did not receive a receipt for original purchase. . . On 04/11, the sales clerk (from the original sale) took my email address and said I would receive an email with the receipt. This did not arrive, so I had to waste time going to customer services to ask for a printout of the original receipt. . . Problem #2: Wasted customers time. . . On 11/11, the sales clerk (to whom I was returning the faulty item) told me that the receipt would be in the Bijenkorf App. He told me to download the app. I downloaded it, and the purchase was not listed there. He said that he would need to ask his manager what to do, then disappeared with the item. . . Problem #3: Customer stands around with no explanation and then has to go somewhere else for help. . . After waiting for 15 minutes, another clerk advised me to go to Customer Services on the 5th floor to get a printout of the receipt. . . Problem #4: Manager did not listen to my concerns. . . The sales clerk, customer service agent and a store manager showed up at the Customer Service desk. The manager explained that his sales clerk told him that the item was used and could not be refunded. I explained that *you have to remove the adhesive label in order to install the product* and there was no mention of this item not working on specific surfaces on the packaging. He said that you have to assume some level of responsibility for finding this out yourself. He did not accept my explanation and said that the item could not be resold and had to be thrown away.

We went to 2 different shops, the one in our city and the one in Rotterdam where he bought the shoes. Both gave us a completely different answer to our question, which was: “can we get a refund on the shoes? This means that the quality of the shoe is bad and that is the right we have as a customer”. The Hague said that we ether could get a refund or a giftcard. Too bad we didn’t buy the shoes in The Hague but in Rotterdam so we had to go to Rotterdam for the complaint. Well in Rotterdam they were not so nice, they said it was all my boyfriend’s fault by buying the shoes too big and walking all wrong on them, which was not the case and if it was the case the shoes were poorly manufactured because he only wore them three times. Fast forward 2 months later, we had finally reached contact with the store throughout e-mails and they said to send the shoes to Italy where the manufacturer is located. When we suddenly got the shoes back we didn’t hear anything from the store. My boyfriend wasn’t okay with this and we sent several more e-mails, finally we went to a lawyer who had also sent three e-mails.

3377,32,Myrthe Huisman,1,NL,1,Customer service is really bad,"Hello,. . I had to go and write a review about the Bijenkorf. My boyfriend bought expensive shoes that had worn two or three times. We went to 2 different shops, the one in our city and the one in Rotterdam where he bought the shoes. Both gave us a completely different answer to our question, which was: “can we get a refund on the shoes? This means that the quality of the shoe is bad and that is the right we have as a customer”. The Hague said that we ether could get a refund or a giftcard. Too bad we didn’t buy the shoes in The Hague but in Rotterdam so we had to go to Rotterdam for the complaint. Well in Rotterdam they were not so nice, they said it was all my boyfriend’s fault by buying the shoes too big and walking all wrong on them, which was not the case and if it was the case the shoes were poorly manufactured because he only wore them three times. Fast forward 2 months later, we had finally reached contact with the store throughout e-mails and they said to send the shoes to Italy where the manufacturer is located. When we suddenly got the shoes back we didn’t hear anything from the store. My boyfriend wasn’t okay with this and we sent several more e-mails, finally we went to a lawyer who had also sent three e-mails. Still, 6 months later nothing had happened and we are stuck with the broken expensive shoes.",2020-07-11 09:42:14+00:00,1,2020-07-16 14:53:09.704000+00:00,"Hi Myrthe,I can not find anything about this in our system, so I can not really reply to your story in depth.Perhaps you can send a message about this on Whatsapp or the chat?

3498,57,Devesh Chaturvedi,30,GB,1,Worst customer service with employees with big attitude problem,This evening a few of us went to buy gifts for our families after a holiday in the Netherlands before going back home in various parts of the globe. One of the sales associates was extremely rude and probably lacked basic customer services skills. I spoke with the manager and he was even worse. The associate became even more rude in front of the manager and he was looking clueless.
