Tried to make a straight forward family hotel booking through them.

Took me 2 hours of emails, online messaging, and finally a phone call to get the refund, despite the hotel confirming their ""Key Worker"" requirement. Booking.com didn't want to give me a refund.

Booking.com said there were mentions in the 'small print' of the booking. Where? No idea. Shouldn't be in the 'small print', the family reservation should not have been taken at all from the start.

To start, I initially had a room reserved with The Linq Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada from April 1- April 4 and then had to move the reservation up one day. Was told it was handled. When I arrived at my hotel the hotel informed me my reservation had been cancelled due to a no show (the original date before the change). Veronica from Booking.com couldn’t get the reservation figured out and promised me she’d send me an alternative itinerary in “one half hour. I have my tinder set” - Veronica, in fact, never contacted me again. So there I was a single female, traveling alone with luggage in hand waiting my entire first evening for an itinerary. Mind you it was my sister’s wedding rehearsal dinner that I missed during this. Booking.com has offered to pay the difference of the hotel I booked (at 1 am when I was supposed to be in by 7 pm the previous day) but is giving me the run around with the verification process.

33,marco p,1,ZA,1,I booked a guest house in South Africa…,"I booked a guest house in South Africa through booking.com in December 2020. When myself and my team arrived, it was not what we had booked, we were a team of 6 adult men on a company conference trip, therefore we booked three rooms of 100sqm (supposed to be huge) with two double beds inside each room. When we arrived late at night, they had given us 3 x rooms of around 15sqm each with one double bed in each room and had no more rooms to assist us. As it was late at night we had no option but to take the rooms and have some adults share a bed and other adults sleep on the floor (that were not comfortable with sharing a small bed, or against their culture). The next day we left the guest house, as they could not give us the rooms that we had originally booked due to being at full capacity and over booking their rooms. Therefore we contacted booking.com, and booking.com told us they would refund us, as their policy is either an equivalent room or better (which we did not get). Since then booking.com has used every excuse not to refund us, with their latest argument being that the amount we payed was a value in Rands but our bank statement (yes we had to send our bank statement proving we paid the guest house) shows a value in Meticais. seeing as we from Mozambique our local currency is meticais and when our bank charges us it is in meticais. But this is very common as wherever one travels in the world they can pay on a card machine any currency, and then the clients bank will convert that currency into their local currency on the spot rate plus whatever the bank charges. Booking.com has told me I am the first person this has happened to?? They even asked us to get a stamped letter from our bank, for our bank to state what amount entered the bank in ZAR (South African currency), and what exchange rate they used to translate to the value showing on my bank statement in Meticais. After much talk with our bank we managed to get this, now booking.com has told us they unfortunately cannot assist, as our bank should of charged us in Rands (ZAR), and our bank statement should show the Rands amount, which is impossible. Therefore we had to just accept the 7,480.00 ZAR the guest house and booking.com basically stole from us. 
I told booking.com they should have a disclaimer stating they don't recognize certain currencies from certain countries, and their hosts should not accept cards from certain foreign countries then. Booking.com just said whenever we get quoted a currency, we must just pay that currency, therefore if you are traveling, make sure you don't arrive at a foreign hotel without drawing the local currency first, as booking.com won't recognize your payment otherwise.",2021-04-08 14:25:36+00:00,0,,-,booking.com

I have made numerous complaints to customer service explaining what happened with the above booking.​

Customer service advised me that according to the owner, the room was available but I declined the room, which was not true, and I have explained exactly what happened.​ ​ I have send the communication between the Guest House and myself proofing that the room was indeed no longer available, which I wasn't informed about before arrival.

I made several complaints about the misconduct at the other Guesthouse (Golf view Guesthouse) which she offered, I have also send pictures to customer services showing the state of the accomodation and all the other misconduct which happened there.

Also complained and informed customer service regarding the owner of Beit Shalom Guesthouse threatening me.

Nothing has been done by Customer service at Booking.com, I have send numerous messages from the day we left, on Booking.com website it states that misconduct, illegal activity and unhygienic accommodation should be reported by the guest, also if Covert-19 regulations aren't being followed or in place, which I have done, but absolutely no attempt from Customer services to assist, you advertise guests safety but if misconduct is reported, nothing are being done.

I also complained to Booking.com about the fact that they advertised a room, which I booked and paid for, received booking confirmation, this was done before 11 on Saturday morning, 27th March, and we arrived at the Guesthouse at 4, when I was informed that the room wasn't available, and actually been occupied since the previous day, which yet again proof the incompetence of Customer service, since I should have been informed before arrival at the Guesthouse, which would have allowed me enough time to book alternative accommodation.

But it was not sufficient for them??  as if it was not enough... they finally send me a refund,only after I ask the owner of the close hotel to call them (which was not my job to do, they should have been the one doing that investigation)and guess what with 13$ missing... not a big deal, but I definetly want all my penny back.

I booked a holiday to attend a wedding for my family (6 adults and 4 children).  When the confirmation came it said 9 adults. I queried this to be told it was what I had asked for. When I pointed out my room requests for rooms for children with their ages they said I must have sent this after. (Which was untrue). I had requested to pay on arrival but I noticed the minute I complained they took over €230 from my card as a non returnable deposit, I did not agree to this. To resolve what is there mess I will either have to loose the deposit or pay for another person.During my 2 1/2 hour telephone calls i asked on several occasions to speak to a manager but was refused. In the end I asked for a managers email address and was also refused this.

95,Jacob Walker,5,US,1,"Booking Holdings Inc - UNETHICAL COVID PROFITEERS $2,000.00 TAKEN NO SERVICES RENDERED","I paid Agoda.com (a subsidiary of Booking.com, Booking Holdings Inc.) $2,000.00 in good faith for a hotel in Thailand for 15 nights of mandatory state quarantine.

On arrival at the 5-star hotel, I found it smelt musky and damp and immediately moved to another hotel, for which I had to pay another $2,000.00.

After politely requesting a refund from Agoda.com I was instantly denied without any apology. Later Agoda.com apologized and offered just $196.08 in Agoda credit which I promptly rejected.

Agoda stated that the refund policy was as follows: ""This booking is Non-Refundable and cannot be amended or modified. Failure to arrive at your hotel or property will be treated as a No-Show and will incur a charge of 100% of the booking value (Hotel policy).""

However, these terms and conditions clearly do not apply in this instance as I arrived at the hotel on schedule, and this fact has been well established and proven.

Furthermore, it was an implied term of my contract with Agoda that the accommodation provided would be of a standard of cleanliness and quality reasonably expected from this type and price of a 5-star hotel.

Therefore, as the hotel smelt musky and damp and was not described, this is nothing but thief and bandit behavior from Agoda that's totally unacceptable, immoral, and unethical, especially in the current financial climate.

In conclusion, Agoda.com has banked my $2,000.00 for doing absolutely nothing, and worse of all, Agoda obviously thinks they are perfectly entitled to do just that.

Throughout my emails with Agoda, I have copied in the 28 board members of Agoda's parent company Booking Holdings Inc, the board of Agoda Company Pte. Ltd., and The Priceline Group's board as they are all in the same group.

Of all the board members, nobody cares, and all appear to be complicit in this type of behavior and treatment of customers.

As a matter of principle, I now have to go through the hassle of taking legal action against Agoda.com to recover my losses.

Do not give Agoda.com, Priceline.com, or Booking.com (same group of companies) your business or hard-earned money; these companies are in serious financial trouble, clearly cannot be trusted, and will take your money and keep it without a second thought.

I think it is not reasonable to put myself in enforced quarantine for 14 days in Taiwan for only a Trip for FOUR days. That is a common sense for everyone!    

I understand that it is a difficult situation for everyone, but it is NOT AN EXCUSE provide nearly ZERO customer services. This is a very DISAPPOINTING experience.

QUOTE
Thank you for your message.
Counterfeit goods are becoming an increasingly widespread problem, and consumers are the first victims. They end up paying for a fragrance or cosmetic product that has neither the same quality nor the same safety guarantees as the original product. The counterfeiter doesn’t just deceive the consumer, but also seriously jeopardises their health and safety. 
Counterfeiting equally damages our brand’s image and puts jobs in our industry at risk. 
For all these reasons, any purchase made outside of our approved distribution network carries a risk for which we cannot be held responsible. 
We strongly recommend verifying prior to purchase that the point of sale is part of our approved distribution network. BOL.COM. is currently not one of our approved distributors. 
Yours sincerely,

43,Ross,3,GB,1,Worst selling platform in europe,"Customer service should be renamed 'sales support' because that's all they'll help with.

Terrible attitude to business users, might as well use Amazon if I wanted to deal with an areshole and some badly scripted bots.

Will never buy from Bol again

Lie no 1:
Customer service staff can't access personal info when working from home... unless you're question relates to buying something....

lie no 2: 
Your issue has been forwarded to IT

my actual issue was a technical issue which wouldn't allow me to reset my password.

44,tve,2,NL,1,Seriously disappointed in their service.,"Ordered a refrigerator from bol.com. First, the delivery service PostNL doesn't want to take the old refrigerator, even though bol.com promises this on their site. Called bol.com, they will pick up tomorrow. Okay, so far. Then, as I unpack the new one, it turns out the door is severely damaged. Called Bol.com again. They don't give me money back, but only giftcards (I exchanged another non-bol.com giftcard for these, to buy this refrigerator - now I'm apparently stuck with bol). I cannot get a replacement and have to order again (...) and let them take this damaged one, next week (it's Thursday now). And then, maybe, the whole cycle starts again. Let's see. So far I am seriously disappointed in their service.

Update 1, 20210130: And OF COURSE they're going to send it via PostNL, so AGAIN they won't take my old fridge. PLUS a big chance the thing arrives damaged yet AGAIN.

Update 2, 20210130: NOT delivering today. I'll have to wait till Tuesday. Put the old fridge back for now then. (Of course then I can defrost and clean the thing all over again before pickup... whenever that is going to be.) Also already planned with them for a pickup of the old fridge on Wednesday, because they're definitely going through PostNL again, and won't pickup my old fridge when they drop off the (hopefully not again damaged) new one.

Update 3, 20210131: Hm... Bol.com contacting me 'as soon as possible' based on my review apparently doesn't mean 'at least within 3 days after we said that'.

Update 4, 20210201: PostNL guy comes up to the house holding the new fridge by the bands around the box. Needles to say, this one's damaged as well. Again, I'm calling with bol.com. NOW all of a sudden it IS possible to replace the damaged machine. They'll call me to arrange delivery (again, via PostNL) and pickup of the broken second fridge. (Third time's a charm? I won't get my hopes up.)

20210204, last update: Fridge #3 also damaged at arrival. I give up. Last thing they're going to try for me is putting my money on my bank account, instead of back on the gift cards that are registered with them.

One more update on this: in the end they could not give me the money back, because of the risk of 'money laundering', so I HAD to order again from them. This time I ordered from a third party. Everything went well.

Oh, and 'Chantal' never contacted me. I think she is a bot or something, just automatically pasting the same response over and over again on every review.",2021-01-28 15:58:24+00:00,1,2021-01-28 17:24:55.403000+00:00,"Hello Tve,Thank you for your review.

45,Mahmood Shafeie Zargar,2,NL,1,Dishonest shop with no customer service,"This is a terrible service no one should use. A bug in their system made them deliver my parcels to an address that I changed during the purchase process. I called them once I noticed that the address was wrong (before delivery), and they accused me of changing the address in the system after the order (well, they could check that if they wanted, but there is no L2 customer service with privilege to check that). So they said what is done is done and I have to arrange it with my former neighbours (that I am not in touch with). When I insisted this is horrible customer service and I cannot be held responsible to fix the issue their system created, they simply hung up on me. When I said I will reject the credit card expense they simply threatened to follow up on it in justice. Just order everything on Amazon.de or Coolblue and you will know that you are always right and you won’t pay for buggy software and incompetent customer service.

Quick follow up: The part of the order that hasn’t been shipped yet comes from Bol marketplace and with a carrier that they claim can update the address. With their recommendation I got in touch with the carrier, but the carrier said only the sender can change the address. But the sender on Bol marketplace doesn’t really exist in the outside world. It’s just an address on Google maps with no contact number or email address associated with it. Their website doesn’t work either!",2021-01-27 10:58:27+00:00,1,2021-01-27 11:50:25.760000+00:00,"Hello Mahmood,Thank you for your review.

50,Maranon Swasey,1,NL,1,Never refunded twice!! Almost 200 euros gone,"I order from bol regularly but lately it’s been the most horrific experience. They don’t keep their vendors accountable. First item, I ordered through bol and it was delivered to a post nl pickup point and unfortunately I was late getting to it so it was returned to seller. Post nl shows that it was sent to the seller but I was never refunded. I contacted bol.com and all they do is have a terrible chat experience and tell you to resolve with the seller. I still haven’t been refunded my 100 euros.

2nd time was in January of this year where I ordered an item and it was never shipped. Again they told me to contact the seller. The seller responded claiming they had a fire and could no longer send my item and would refund me. It’s been 2 weeks and no refund. When you go onto bol.con they continue to tell you to resolve with the seller. They really have some bad business practices. I recommend just ordering directly through reputable businesses and never dealing with bol and their terrible vendors",2021-01-23 04:48:06+00:00,1,2021-01-28 13:19:37.541000+00:00,"Beste Maranon,Dank voor je review.

I returned the monitor, however I did not get money back for 2 months, upon querying, they said it is due to corona and will process it as soon as possible. 

After few weeks I get e-mail saying the return is denied due to “traces of use” and got back the monitor. Upon rechecking the monitor, the only thing I found was faint fingerprints which I could easily wipe with microfiber cloth and probably was there when I was dismantling.

I raised this issue to Bol.com, however the bol.com responded that seller has rejected the return due to “traces of use” and they couldn’t do anything about it since 14 days return policy is over although it was the seller who took over 2+ months to process this.

Now I am stuck with a monitor I cannot use properly.

I thought I could buy products from Bol.com and was protected but it seems they don’t seem to care that much.

Hi All, 

I am writing this email with highest order of grief and frustration. I knew the Dutch company headquartered in NL Bol.com is an ethical company until I spoke with one of your client service employees who was very rude and probably a believer of white supremacy. This guy hang up the phone on me and didn't speak in English with me even a single word which seemed intentional. I have been a long time customer of Bol.com, but now will stop using Bol.com and rather move to other new eCommerce channels. If this is the service you give to a doctor in Belgium, just because I don't speak Netherlands fluently, you need to retrospect and probably introspect also, are you doing the right thing? Please stop spreading hate among people. Please take this email seriously, otherwise I will take this matter to social media for sure.

Irresponsible company who 
a)cancels your orders without your involvement referring to issues with your card 
b) charges your card (which has issues as they say) and uses a possibility of holding your money for 5 days to earn interest on it I suppose???
c) has a customer service who gives you very generic answers without any solutions or proposals on the issue or closing chat instead of answering your questions.
My money are still on hold, and not you only didn't fulfill the order but you don't allow me to place it somewhere else by holding my money!!!

I did not believe that and wrote a review in English, which they did not publish.

They lie publicly that they do publish English reviews (I asked them in Twitter). Nevertheless my review never got published. I also never heard from bol.com for it breaking any kinds of rules.

Generally, Bol.com's policy of ""we can remove your review without any notice"" is highly abusive. If you ask your clients to spend time on reviews, then make your colleagues accountable for their decisions of not publishing them. Or, just say frankly ""we will remove your review if stars come together that way, or if our moderator doesn't want to learn English, or if we want to deceive people into buying this product and you gave it too few stars"".",2020-12-08 15:04:22+00:00,1,2020-12-11 16:30:09.784000+00:00,"Hello Anna,Thank you for your review.

I made an order for a speaker, was pleased when I received an email 2 days after saying my item was being shipped and even more pleased 3 days later when it said it was out for delivery. I then received an email saying my order couldn't be delivered as the courier couldn't locate the address and my item was being returned and I was being refunded. I was baffled as I had given a clear box number and address in Belgium. I immediately contacted the courier who advised it was out of their hands and I had to deal with Bol.com directly. I checked the addresses I provided and I could see Bol.com failed to provide the courier with the first lines of my address I attempted to call their customer service several times but couldn't get through. The absolutely awful chat option on the site was of no use whatsoever. Finally I got through on Facebook and sent screenshots and full info showing their mistake and asking for them to reship the item and rectify their stupid and inexplicable mistake. I received a 'whoops don't know how that happened sorry but its out of stock now nothing we can do, reorder' response. Their customer service was appalling and I am embarrassed for every single member of staff I spoke to as they were all so incompetent at such a simple job. I asked for a manager call back on three separate occasions and every agent ignored this request. The item I purchased is now €100 more expensive and I should not have to pay this for a mistake that was not my own and was solely the fault of the company I purchased the item from. I have reported the company to the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets.",2020-12-03 11:50:35+00:00,1,2020-12-03 15:20:47.523000+00:00,"Hi Michelle,Thank you for your review.

93,Alejandra Tejera,1,BE,1,BOL.COM has just lost a very active…,"BOL.COM has just lost a very active buyer. 

I called their client service to complain that the ‘pick-up’ shop where my parcel had been delivered to not only had not given it to me, but that i got verbally abused. They claimed they did not have my package in their shop even though i double checked later on with Dpd and they confirmed this. The shop was in extreme disorder, so logically they did not find the parcel under a mountain of other parcels. Instead of owning up to it, they got defensive and extremely abusive. I called bol.com to complain about the ‘missing’ parcel and the only solution they had to offer was, and I quote: ‘to go back to the shop and implore them to give me my parcel back’. The first time around i got verbally abused by the owner, so, logically, it is up to me to ‘implore’ to this, for lack for a better expression, ‘woman-beater’ so that i get physically hurt. Not an apology or a ‘we will reimburse you’. This person from the ‘klantenservice’ went as far as saying that i could be lying and that the version of the shop owner had to be heard. Really? As much as such a high level of fairness and acute sense of justice is commendable, he is directing it towards someone who not only is not a customer, but has abused the latter. Bravo BOL for your great customer-service skills and for having added insult to injury!! I will not forget this and will not spend a dime again at bol.com until this situation is cleared and i have received an apology.

Convinced it was a fluke, I ordered an Oculus Quest 2 a week ago.

After having to call three times before getting a hold of them, they gave me one solution; they’d send me a mail with retour instructions. I received an email, but the one i should’ve gotten with the lable i needed to print out didn’t come, so i emailed back and then i got it finally. 19th of February we’ve send my expensive laptop through the mail back to them to let them repare it, as they should because it has 2 years guarantee. After not hearing from them for a week I was like why didn’t i get a confirmation that they’ve received it. So i called. Even calling took me three times because they take ages before picking up the phone. Something had went wrong in their administration. They told me they had to do research about why they didn’t have it in their system yet. 5 workdays more waiting! It’s my laptop that i use and need for my school work. Im in college. I need a good functioning laptop. So i messaged them, and they offered me a laptop to use while they repair mine, the catch was THAT I HAD TO BUY IT FIRST AND THEN USE IT AND THEN HOPE FOR MY MONEY BACK. First off all i’m not spending any more money at their site because they are NOT to be trusted, second of all, after all of this mess they give me that option as “service”?

Top! #3 DHL messed up the delivery of the replacement pillow; they apparently took it to a ""neighbour"" and wrote a non-existing address for it, so no way for me to find where they took it. I called customer service, and a (2nd) replacement pillow was immediately on its way.

6,Maxime Lechner,1,NL,1,Horrible experience with Wehkamp,"Horrible experience with Wehkamp. Had an incorrect side of a closet delivered, and after a month waiting the correct side is still not delivered to me. I am contacting customer service every week now who blame it on DHL, but in the meantime ordered something else with a gift card and that got delivered normally. Every time I’m calling I’m waiting for about 30 minutes and wehkamp fails to correctly tell me when the correct side will be delivered every time. I sent in a complaint but they never got back to me on that.

I will never order something here again. Horrible customer service - they told me to get rid of the closet side myself and I had to ask for something of a compensation. Meanwhile I’m still living out of boxes because I don’t have a close yet.",2021-01-03 13:09:57+00:00,1,2021-01-03 13:51:46.434000+00:00,"Good afternoon,I am happy to process your complaint.

7,Frank Damiano,2,NL,1,Bad experience overall,"Bad experience overall, the system allows you to order goods with the option of paying later (after receiving the product). The customer service called me to verify my order and questioned me extensively about my identity and personal data and at the end they deemed that the order was not real and cancelled it. I told them that they should then not offer the “pay later” option but ask payment right away. The employee was unprofessional and rude and at the end of the call she hung up on me. I called back to ask explanation and after 20 minutes waiting I was attended by someone that didn’t even speak english. 
Waited the whole day for the delivery of the product which obviously did not arrive, i called the customer service again and after 45 minutes wait I was told that the rude employee had originally blocked and cancelled my order. So I paid for a product and while the system mentioned that the product was coming it actually never left the shop.

Never had such a miserable experience in the Netherlands. Never again Wehkamp. This company fully deserves to go bust.

Addendum: In the end I got my money back, but had to call multiple times and wait 15 days or so.",2020-12-22 19:43:06+00:00,1,2020-12-22 20:13:56.878000+00:00,"Response to your revised reviewGood morningWe are very sorry that you did not have a good experience with us.

-Customer service confirmed me via phone and Facebook my order will come on Wednesday... and it won't (with all the hassle included, because in this case, I needed an extra company to lift my sofa)

My refund was completed a month later in two parts, although none of my actions were related to this problem. On the top of this inconvenience, as an English speaker, my communication to customer service has been in English, however their replies have been in Dutch, which I find particularly rude. Last, their customer service chat app, that I had to download, was not working properly within their communicated working hours, which also created unnecessary inconvenience to me.

29,Marian,5,NL,1,I thought I was a loyal customer...,"So I have been a customer now 7 years of Wehkamp and I have no open invoices. Always paid them full. I have been using the service ‘ achteraf betalen (like after pay)’ since I got to know of it. I thought it was brilliant! Because this service made me go on like a shopping spree whenever I felt like it, or needed something last minute. But just like ‘normal shopping’, the clothes don’t always fit like you hoped/imagine it would. So I also make use of the return service but always kept something and paid for it. Like I said no open invoices. Little did I know that the combination of ‘achteraf betalen’ and so many returns would lead to me now not having the option ‘achteraf betalen’ anymore. Don’t get me wrong, I understand that there are processes to maintain. But the fact that I didn’t get an email or message upfront about this, where as in the conditions it says I would, I find this very bad customer service. And also while I wanted to place my order and at the step of choosing ‘my’ payment option it said ‘Iets is mis gegaan met jouw betaling..probeer het opnieuw’. So I kept trying 2 days in a row. So decided to call customer service. The ladies were polite, but they couldn’t help me. They could just explain me the why and pass on my feedback. I mean come on Wehkamp ..at least send me a personal message why I cannot longer make use if the service....

30,Sylver May,1,NL,1,So apparently it's MY task to figure out what went wrong,"I ordered a pair of shoes on 29-11-19, and they were said to arrive on the 30th - Not only did they not come in, my package went 'missing' (it is said to still be in the shipping station) in shipment. I then proceeded to contact both the shipping company (DHL) and wehkamp multiple times, and every time I kept hearing excuse after excuse - After 6 days, so today, I had to call in again to check on my shipment, they decided to tell me 'oh, they are not available at this time, sorry!'. There was no sincerity in their apology, no truth to their word, just a quick 'good luck with that!'. They said that they will look into what went wrong, but I will not be getting my money back until then, and I have very little faith that they'll actually check what happened - I'll probably just be another file on the shelf. 

I'm appaled by their horrid customer service, I'm annoyed that I had to call in after they made a mistake instead of them trying to solve it, and the fact that they didn't make an effort to inform me so I could order them on time somewhere else is just terribly saddening and I do not plan on ordering from them again.",2019-12-05 13:15:19+00:00,1,2019-12-06 07:17:23.873000+00:00,"Goodmorning,I am sorry for all the inconveniences.

The carrier claimed that I did not open the door, but I have been home the whole day to make sure I do not miss it and the bell has not been rung. Not even once. I live in a studio apartment so it is quite impossible to miss such a loud bell in such a small place.

Now I have a new appointment for tomorrow. Do I need to hope on not getting it cancelled for the 3rd time or will the carrier actually ring my bell and pick up the item??

33,Edward Frederick Good,2,NL,1,Used a €15 gift voucher from my work,"Used a €15 gift voucher from my work, received for my birthday, to buy a small gift from Wehkamp. A fun light box on which you could write messages.

The gift voucher was validated at the time of purchase and I paid the remaining €3 via iDeal.

Months later I am told I am liable for a debt of €60 which has been refered to a third party collection agency (Vesting finance). Apparently there was an issue with my gift voucher, despite this being validated at the time of purchase. 

Wehkamp have admitted no fault in the this process, despite being contacted and have advised that this is my fault for not responding to several emails requesting payment in the meantime. Note that these emails requesting payment from Wehkamp look very much like spam (any email from an 'official' looking sender requesting to click on a link to payment are 99% of the time spam and should be fully treated as such).",2019-08-12 07:43:46+00:00,1,2019-08-12 08:11:52.202000+00:00,"Dear Edward,Thanks for your message.

First, the delivery guys were awesome! They tried to bring the big packages via stip narrow stairs and when it didn't work they had to bring it back. But it was not a problem for them.
The material of the item is very good, I had it in a rose color and the quality of the material is also good and look very stylish. But the density of the seat foam is low and not sturdy, low quality. Also, it is not equal density on the edges and in the middle, weird, like used or something. Anyway, not good. So those would be low budget items I would say. If you are not on a budget buy sofa somewhere else.",2019-06-08 14:35:34+00:00,0,,-,wehkamp.nl

38,Kristina,7,NL,1,"SAVE YOURSELF SOME MONEY AND TROUBLE, DONT BUY FROM THEM.","This is my first time using wehkamp and I ordered from them in good faith. I am disappointed with the services especially their delivery. The delivery person refused to bring my package to my door, and instead asked me to come down to our apartment building door to get my package. He said that my package was big and he would like me to get it and bring it upstairs myself. Lol. He’s suppose to deliver in my address, our building door is not my address. And to add up to my annoyance, is how he took care of my order. It was covered with mud and its really annoying that some mud came in the plastic and to the carpet i ordered. He just dragged it on the dirty muddy ground like he doesnt care! How lazy! Now my carpet is dirty. Its new and it is very nice but its dirty. Its a 100€ carpet and he just trashed it like that! I dont know well about your company but if you have bad delivery service like that it will drag your name down the drain. I rate my experience with wehkamp to one star. 

Btw, i got a response from customer service about my complaint and they just gave me a 7,50€ voucher to compensate for their incompetence, like thats suppose to make me feel better?

41,Weiyang Zhu,1,NL,1,I feel very disappointing,"I feel very disappointing about wehkamp's service. 
I placed an order on Nov 23 because of the Black Friday action. It is not an action by wehkamp but by the miele official website. So if I purchase certain product between Nov 23 and Nov 25 from their retailer I can get cash back from miele.
However there is some problem with the delivery. I called the customers service several times and finally we found the product is back to the stock. So I placed the order again, and the wehkamp promised that they will make sure that the order proof would be on Nov 23.
But when I finally received the product on Dec 3 I found that the invoice is still not correct. I called them again and the lady said her colleague will send me the correct invoice with correct date by email.
another day, I received the email from Wehkamp, they said there was no action by miele. I sent them the screen shot of the action but I received another email, they just ignore my screen shot and said it is not the product I ordered. I was so angry because the mechine type was clearly stated in my screen shot and I have highlighted it. 
I asked them to check it again and I have not received any reply since that....
It is a long story but I feel real angry and helpless. I think the customers service is not friendly nor professional. I dont know now where to complain this issue because I tried telephone and email and the only thing I got is disappointment. AND WASTE OF TIME!!!

45,SJ,2,NL,5,Very satisfied!,"I only ordered with Wehkamp one time but I'm very satisfied.
First of all, Wehkamp had the cheapest price of all other websites and shops in Rotterdam. 
I ordered Puma shoes but when they arrived I found out they were too small. The next day I went to a DHL service point to get them returned to Wehkamp and immediately ordered the right size online.
I received my right sized shoes on a Sunday(!) morning, the day it heavily snowed(!) 

Via the code I received at the DHL service point I could see where my returned shoes were and a couple of days later I received the full amount of the returned shoes back on my bank account!

Maybe there should be an option for 'swapping' in the future, so I wouldn't have to pay twice and Wehkamp doesn't have to return the money once. But I'm really happy with the great service!",2017-12-16 10:26:43+00:00,0,,-,wehkamp.nl

63,Danielly,1,NL,1,My order didn't arrive and they don't even care,"I ordered a bed at wehkamp.nl and the first problem appeared when I received an email telling they didn't have the product in stock (even the website saying they had) and I would have an one week delay in my delivery. I accepted, since I was buying the bed for my mother and she would arrive 3 weeks later. The bed delivery was scheduled to 04/08 between 9:45 and 11:45. I waited all day at home and nothing.

I contacted Wehkamp and then I got nothing than excuses for one week, telling they were contacting PostNL Extra@Home to know what happened and asking them to call me to solve the situation. Tired of waiting and almost beg to know why I wasn't receiving any call or some solution, I called Extra@Home by myself and surprise: they had to cancel my delivery because Wehkamp didn't send them my full order. It should be 3 pieces, but they just got 2 and since 04/08 they are waiting to receive the missing piece from Wehkamp.

I contacted Wehkamp again telling what I discovered and the answer was ""that's a pity"" and that the back office would investigate. I talk with Wehkamp every single day and they are unable to give me some estimative to solve my problem. My mother will arrive very soon with no bed and all Wehkamp do is give me excuses, not a deadline.

All the answers are very vague. And they already lied in my first contact when they told it was Extra@Home fault. Looks like they're doing nothing to solve this problem and I just want to have the product I already paid for and they committed to deliver at 04/08.

I need a deadline, I need a solution. Wehkamp refuses to give me that and just say they're investigating and trying to discover what happened. Honestly I don't care what happened anymore, I just want my order so my mother will have a bed. I don't have time to buy another one and wait the deliver, I don't have another week.

This experience is terrible and I would not recommend Wehkamp to anyone. The store is amazing until something happen and you need the customer service. They just don't seem to care or even do something about the problem.

There is no number 9 on my street,  chatted with Budbee again.

If you cannot guarantee that your partner will ship it in same time then don’t even offer fast shipping 😤 
The thing is that both items were Adidas brand. But both of them came from different places. The shop could have just transferred the full list to Adidas and tell them that I’ve paid for fast shipping. So both items would also be in same packaging. 

I know some people would probably read this and say - it doesn’t work like that . 
But at least then don’t offer free shipping if it isn’t even guaranteed from your partner.

So postNL ignored the poststamp and sent it to Zalando, which much have been surprised. They however took the time and effort to ship it back to the seller, after which PostNL delivered it again at Zalando. Zalando sent it back yet again to the seller, who then shipped it to me (in a different box).

58,ER,15,NL,1,Pathetic.,"Zalando failed to provide correct address details to the courier, DHL. DHL could not change the delivery address, so asked me to contact Zalando. What a disaster that was. 

I was met with customer service who treated me like an inconvenience. No apology offered, no solution for their mistake. The agent was sighing and interrupting me constantly. I explained to her that Zalando's confirmation email contained the correct details but that DHL seem to be missing them. She said she would check, then came back and told me what I literally just told her. So in short, she was not even listening. When I said, ""I know, that's why I'm calling, I've spoken to DHL and they said to contact you."" 
She said, ""Yeah, well, I don't know what's going on but this order didn't come from us. It came from our partners"". 
She was very quick to shrug off the blame onto their ""partners"". I made it clear that I don't care whose fault it is, I ordered from Zalando and expect service from the company that received my payment. 

I was then told to wait 2 weeks to ""see what happens"". That is not a solution. Telling me to contact DHL to amend the details myself, when I already said they couldn't help me, is not a solution. Asked to speak to a supervisor, they couldn't forward my call. Asked for a supervisor to call me back, they can't make outbound calls.

This is an official complaint about your highly disappointing services. As a customer I feel misled and let down by you. 

After buying shoes that sadly were the wrong size I’ve had countless issues in trying to return them. Firstly, I was told that you could not pay for the return of the shoes but if I paid for it then you would return them to the address which I ordered them from. I paid for the return to Germany which was not cheap and waited upon a reply. After not hearing back from you I was concerned and thus contacted you, you told me the shoes had not been received. I took it upon myself to look where the shoes were and they were left at the post office in Germany. I contacted your team and was told that you could not retrieve them from the post office. This is highly absurd. Why would you ask me to send them there if they could not be retrieved? How am I supposed to deal with the post office? This is a mistake on your end that must be fixed. 

This issue has gone on for far too long. As a customer I feel misled and have been left severely disappointed with your service. Your team have not been helpful and I demand to know what you are going to do to resolve this issue. 

I look forward to hearing from you with a resolution.

No explanation for that, almost impossible to get someone from the customer service, when I got one, she was very rude and uninterested. Their Facebook page is a joke. Many promises they would get back to me, it never occurred. They justify all delays with "" it's because of the Corona""... how pathetic.. they should be simply be ashamed of themselves..

The story is long but in short:
- ordered a product
- delivery company said that I refused the parcel but I never received anything from them
- contacted their chat support and I was told that they will re-send my package to my address
- after 2 days I am receiving an email from them with a refund invoice, so they started the refunding process instead of re-sending my order
- contacting them again through chat and I was told that there is no promise that they can cancel the refund process and I will get an exchange (the same product in exchange.. well how will that would work, the product had a discount so will they exchange the same product at the same price?)
- when discussing on chat, what the employee was explaining seemed too complicated so I just asked her to finish the refund and send me the money back, I do not want the product anymore
- was informed by them on chat I will receive the money back in 5-7 working days
- today, the 7days are gone, no money, contact them again on chat and they told me that it was a mistake, i will get the money in 8 working days and that if I want to get answers to my questions, to call their call center.

I suggested the option to circumvent this issue by me translating the original document and reading it myself, while signing it in the current language (knowing what it says I could sign any document in any language). They rudely declined in person and normally declined by email without even discussing a case that would cost the company 3-4K (with monthly payments this would have gone even higher or even considering future purchases etc.).

I am convinced that I am not the only case that has occured in a multi-national country and a multi-national company, not to mention that many would argue that this discrimination is borderline racist!

Hope someone sees that and take action, cause it is definately not a good practice and most certainly not a good image for the company itself.",2021-01-02 13:40:43+00:00,0,,-,mediamarkt.nl

Went back to store, they said in the customer department there is no appointment even created. And he created for us an appointment for installation. No confirmation on email, no calls, nobody came.

They kept selling the item within the days up until the e-mail, which shows they deliberately sold it while it was out of stock.

I call customer service to get an answer on why the restock date is in the past - they have no clue and said they would contact their back office colleagues and e-mail me by the end of the day - they never did. I try calling again - they don't pick up.

If I try to cancel the order, I would get my money back within a week, so I will be unable to buy from a competitor in time by Black Friday, meaning my best bet is to wait on them. Seeing as they did this deliberately to lock me in with a purchase, shows how predatory they are towards consumers.

They do NOT give  you the option to choose WHEN it will be delivered. It is just ""on the way"" I called to ask to select a time, they said no, their ""policy is to deliver the first time between 0800 and 2000"" (on the day of their choosing) They then stated ""if you aren't available, you can then choose a separate time"".  As they were going to deliver on a Saturday when I was walking from home giving online classes, I asked them to choose another day. They were completely and utterly inflexible. They kept saying it was their policy and refused to use any common sense whatsoever. Additionally this policy is horrific for the environment. Driving around on the offchance the customer ""might"" be at home. 
They told me I would receive a notification 30 minutes before via text that it would arrive. I did not. Their terms had stated that my old fridge has to be disconnected if I wanted them to take it. As I am diabetic and keep medicine in the fridge, I was waiting to at least know the time of arrival to limit having no fridge. They did not tell me, so when they arrived they said they couldn't take the old fridge, but to call and schedule another time no problem. Obviously, they were lying, or the company are liars. Or both. When I called the company, they told me because I had accepted the delivery and the other fridge wasn't ready (regardless of the fact it wasn't ready because I didn't know what time the new one would arrive) they absolutely refused point blank to pick up the old fridge. 
The thing that shocked me the most about  this whole process is the complete and utter lack of any kind of customer service. For a company of this size, you would think after receiving two calls from totally frustrated customers,  they would just come and pick the old fridge up. I now have to get this old fridge up two flights of stairs and into the street by myself. completely impossible.

Cons: 
Customer service is unreachable for days.
No reply on the homepage chat, twitter, facebook. 

My experience with buying a fridge:
- Delivery organized by mediamarkt was terrible, they did not bring the fridge up to the 2nd floor but left it at the apartment building door. That was not communicated. 
- Fridge itself has a low quality in relation to the price. 
- Return process is painful. I want to return the fridge, but the customer service is plainly not responding for DAYS. I tried 3 different social media channels and did not receive a reply. I tried to contact them during working hours. 
- Don't know yet if I'll manage to return the fridge because until now, it's been impossible to arrange the pickup. 

Points to improve:
- a working customer service would be great.
- automate the return process so customers don't need to wait for days to arrange a return pickup.
- delivery of heavy items should be to the apartment door, not the apartment building door. 
- delivery should take the package of big items. 



In comparison, doing a similar process at coolblue for example is super smooth, takes a few clicks, no need to wait for days for a customer service agent to respond.

I paid €1500 in total. After the purchase, I figured the price was divided into 2 items in the invoce; the fridge was around 1000 euros and the vacuum cleaner was around 400 euros. I did not care because the total amount was the same.

After we powered the fridge on, we figured it does not work as it should. I called an official Samsung service, they came to my house and agreed that it has to be changed. I called Mediamarkt, arranged a return because they did not have the same model in their warehouse at that moment. So I decided to have my money back. Mediamarkt also told me that the vacuum cleaner was a gift coming together with the fridge, so I have to return it together with the fridge. I agreed and packed it up as they told me and handed it over to the same guy who got the fridge myself.

After a few days, I had around 1000 euros back in my account. It was exact same amount written for the fridge on the invoce. So, I figured they returned the money for the fridge but the vacuum cleaner. I called Mediamarkt right away and told them I also returned the vacuum cleaner as they told me. First, they told me it was their mistake, they initiated the process and the rest of the money will be in my account within 3 working days. After 3 days I had nothing! (suprise!) Then, I called them again and sent them emails over and over again for 2 months. Answer was always the same: they are working on it.

I ordered a washing Machine, a 55inch smart TV, an Oven and fridge Freezer and i paid with a credit card.
Upon ordering everything showed as in stock until the order was completed when the order confirmed that the Cooker was out of stock.
This was ordered on the 29th  July 2020.
1 week later I was told that the cooker was in stock but now there is a problem with the washing machine and that was now in fact out of stock too.
I was asked if I wanted to wait and was told that it should be in stock in 4 days, so I said I would wait. 

Since then I've been on the phone constantly  trying to get an answer 
I was told 7 days ago that the good have left the depot and been transported to Kos Greece.

I have waiting ever since.
Despite phoning Media Markt constantly 
I was told it would be delivered Monday, I called Monday late afternoon  to be told it will be there Tuesday. 
I called tuesday and was told Wednesday,  I called wednesday and was told Thursday.
Its now Thursday  I called media Markt again to be told probably Monday. 
But no one there can give me a definite answer,
I have been asking all day to speak to a manager, and I have told that one will call me back,
But as of 16.02 still no phone call.
I am calling them back and will be o
But still nothing
I am about to call them again and ask yet again to speak yo a members of management
But I'm not holding g my breath 
Its getting to the point if the goods
Dont show today, its going to be cancelled
If i had ordered it cash on delivery 
They would of been here in 3 days with their hands out for the cash

My rating for their customer service is 0. For such a large corporation I am shocked at how utterly terrible the customer service and cancelation policies are. I am a student and wanted to buy my Christmas presents early this year due to the black Friday. I unfortunately ordered it to my old address in the old city I used to live. I realised my mistake 1 minute later and straight away contacted the customer service and requested my package to be cancelled as I read on your website that orders can be cancelled within 15 minutes after ordering. Your employee at the customer service then confirmed that the order was cancelled and told me ""not to worry"" and that I ""will receive a confirmation email shortly"" and even went to far as to specify that I will receive my money back within 60 days. With this in mind I reorder to my current correct address. The next day after refreshing multiply times I realized that I still haven’t received my confirmation email. I then recontact the customer service and ask why I have not been sent my confirmation email to which I was told “no the employee last night was just looking into cancelling your order”. Not only was I mislead by your employee the first time around by her straight up telling me lies, I am then told that I was wrong to assume that “don’t worry it is cancelled” meant that she had in fact cancelled it.

employee admitted that the mistake was from there side and that the order was not processed because “there was no one in the office” and apologised and wished me luck. She then said that we could change the address to a dhl pickup point. But it is not possible to change it to a different dhl pickup point in a different city which was why I had requested to cancel in the first place! Either your employees are incompetent and don’t know basic English or she never actually processed my cancellation request and is diverting blame by accusing me of misunderstanding her at the time. I am beyond frustrated as I know have 2 exact same orders, I am down €150 (So most likely will not have enough money to buy Christmas presents for the rest of my family) and now have to figure out how to change the address of my first order to a DHL pick up point in a city that I live 3.5 hrs away from. This all could have been avoided if either you employees do their job and cancel my order (as I requested it well within 15 minutes) or that they communicate clearly that they were not able to do their job (as at least this would have saved me from ordering my items twice). I have received ten times better service from start-up companies so this honestly does not reflect well on you and shows that you don’t care about your customers as long as you are profiting from them.",2020-12-03 20:18:44+00:00,1,2020-12-24 13:28:45.189000+00:00,"Hi Danny, I'm sorry to hear that you think a mistake on the part of my colleague is a lie.

26,Tom,5,NL,2,Champagne prices with lemonade service,"On 04/11/2020 at 11:53am, I made several small purchases to the amount of 103,85 from De Bijenkorf in Dam Square. One of those items was a Magisso magnetic cloth holder at a cost of 44,95. I attempted to install the holder on my ceramic sink, but it did not work. The packaging did not mention that the product does not work on ceramic surfaces.

I decided to return the item to the homewares section of De Bijenkorf in Dam Square, but was not refunded as the manager and clerks decided the item was ‘used’. 

This was a service failure all round for the following reasons: 

Problem #1: Did not receive a receipt for original purchase. 

On 04/11, the sales clerk (from the original sale) took my email address and said I would receive an email with the receipt. This did not arrive, so I had to waste time going to customer services to ask for a printout of the original receipt. 

Problem #2: Wasted customers time. 

On 11/11, the sales clerk (to whom I was returning the faulty item) told me that the receipt would be in the Bijenkorf App. He told me to download the app. I downloaded it, and the purchase was not listed there. He said that he would need to ask his manager what to do, then disappeared with the item. 

Problem #3: Customer stands around with no explanation and then has to go somewhere else for help. 

After waiting for 15 minutes, another clerk advised me to go to Customer Services on the 5th floor to get a printout of the receipt. 

Problem #4: Manager did not listen to my concerns. 

The sales clerk, customer service agent and a store manager showed up at the Customer Service desk. The manager explained that his sales clerk told him that the item was used and could not be refunded. I explained that *you have to remove the adhesive label in order to install the product* and there was no mention of this item not working on specific surfaces on the packaging. He said that you have to assume some level of responsibility for finding this out yourself. He did not accept my explanation and said that the item could not be resold and had to be thrown away. But he decided to issue a 25-euro gift card for my trouble was final.

Outcome: 30 minutes to resolve, 15 minutes of keeping the customer waiting without explanation. A 25-euro conciliatory gift card on a 44.95 purchase. 19.95 out of pocket for a faulty item, all because of a piece of paper that was removed from an adhesive label (which had to be removed in order to attempt to install the freaking product!). 

In summary, I found this to be:

- Inefficient and time-consuming.
- A very dogmatic reading of what constitutes a ‘used product’ when the fault lies with the product itself and the lack of explanation on the packaging. 
- Embarrassing: I did not enjoy having to explain myself to 3 different people and leave the store feeling like I’d just stood in front of the Spanish Inquisition. 

I have shopped at for Christmas gifts and homewares at De Bijenkorf for 10 years and spent thousands of euros there. After this experience, I will never shop here again. 

I hope that this shop can live up to its claim of exclusivity and up its service levels, particularly now that there are retailers like amazon.nl and nordicnest.nl who will refund customers for faulty and mislabeled products without interrogating them.",2020-11-11 15:45:18+00:00,1,2020-11-13 10:53:19.743000+00:00,"Hi Tom,I'm sorry that one experience out of many was not satisfactory.

32,Myrthe Huisman,1,NL,1,Customer service is really bad,"Hello,

I had to go and write a review about the Bijenkorf. My boyfriend bought expensive shoes that had worn two or three times. We went to 2 different shops, the one in our city and the one in Rotterdam where he bought the shoes. Both gave us a completely different answer to our question, which was: “can we get a refund on the shoes? This means that the quality of the shoe is bad and that is the right we have as a customer”. The Hague said that we ether could get a refund or a giftcard. Too bad we didn’t buy the shoes in The Hague but in Rotterdam so we had to go to Rotterdam for the complaint. Well in Rotterdam they were not so nice, they said it was all my boyfriend’s fault by buying the shoes too big and walking all wrong on them, which was not the case and if it was the case the shoes were poorly manufactured because he only wore them three times. Fast forward 2 months later, we had finally reached contact with the store throughout e-mails and they said to send the shoes to Italy where the manufacturer is located. When we suddenly got the shoes back we didn’t hear anything from the store. My boyfriend wasn’t okay with this and we sent several more e-mails, finally we went to a lawyer who had also sent three e-mails. Still, 6 months later nothing had happened and we are stuck with the broken expensive shoes.",2020-07-11 09:42:14+00:00,1,2020-07-16 14:53:09.704000+00:00,"Hi Myrthe,I can not find anything about this in our system, so I can not really reply to your story in depth.Perhaps you can send a message about this on Whatsapp or the chat?

Two days later, I've received my order without any issues. I then placed again an order and same thing has happened, after just two days I got my item safely delivered home.

35,Julia,2,DE,1,Bad service,"Two weeks ago I bought a KitchenAid kettle online at De Bijenkorf, thinking that a certain level of service comes with this more luxurious department store.  I even paid 10 euro more to buy it on their website, in order to make sure I get a great customer service when needed. 
Now, two weeks later there is a technical damage to the product but instead of solving the problem for me, they sent me to deal with Kitchen Aid myself (yes, tried the chat function and called you @Bijenkorf). It will now take 2-3 weeks in order for me to get a repair/replacement. This is unacceptable for a rather expensive product and a department store that sees itself as rather exclusive.

The shipping is always speedy and stuff is well packed. I once ordered during a massive sale and an item was missing from my box in all the business. The customer service helped me really fast and returned my money.",2019-05-02 21:36:38+00:00,1,2019-05-03 06:29:34.898000+00:00,"Hi Annabelle, Thank you for your great comments and rating!It is good to read you are so happy with our speed and service.

53,Kitti,1,NL,2,Dirty dust bag,"I ordered a bag from the company's website. It was delivered the next day and the bag itself looks amazing. However, the included dust bag has several dirt patches on it. When I contacted the customer service they replied very fast, but they could only tell me that they don't have spare dust bags and I should try to wash it... It's just SO disappointing and I don't think it should work like this as the product was quite pricey. I'm not sure if I should return the package, as I really like the bag, but I feel let down by the company. They should't sell products with dirty accessories.",2019-04-11 11:23:31+00:00,1,2019-04-16 09:05:10.534000+00:00,"Hello Kitti,I am sorry to read that you have received a dirty dustbag!

55,Robbie,1,NL,1,3 orders in a row came wrong + awful customer service,"I used to buy online on Bijenkorf without any problems. However, the last month I've made 3 purchases, and all of them the item came one size bigger than I ordered! When I tried to change it, the item was sold out so I couldn't get what I bought anymore.

It's just a waste of time and money. To make it up, everytime that happened they gave me €15 gift card (but guess what, I spent that to partially pay my purchase again, the item was wrong and it takes a loooong time to have a refund)

Last time they said they would send me and I didn't receive anything. When I asked about it on whatsapp, the customer service said I was going to get € 10 in 48h (which means the promise on the phone wasn't delivered, since it was a day earlier). When I said this was happening for the 3rd time and I was surprised now she was giving me even less... Here's what she replied me in whatsapp:

I've looked into it.
You were indeed lucky enough to get a giftcard with the generous amount of 15 euros a couple of times before. 
We can not give you such giftcards every time, however. 

I hope you will enjoy your 10 euro giftcard regardless. 

Have a great weekend!

Kind regards,
#bcare/Anneke

I don't think there's any luck in trying to buy something 3 times and not getting it. And I said that and that I was really disappointed with the way she replied me. Then she wrote me back:

I'm sorry to hear you do not appreciate the giftcard for the inconvenience. I can cancel it for you if you like. 

I would still like to wish you a very nice weekend however. 

Kind regards, 
#bcare/Anneke

Well, after that I can only say that not only I'm not satisfied with buying online (who wouldn't?) but also with this customer service, who has no respect for us at all. I think I deserve respect and not irony and disdain. And the ""luck"" of receiving a €10 gift card (which is peanuts considering the items sold at this store) won't have any impact in my life and now in my perception of this store.

To sum up: if you want to receive the right item at home and be treated like a customer should, don't buy at Bijenkorf.

My orders that came wrong were:
- 21133409 (pants - bought size 38, received 40)
- 21258258 (jacket - bought size 40, received 42)
- 21368125 (pants - the same from the first order, that were back in stock - bought size 38, received 40 again)",2019-01-26 21:50:31+00:00,1,2019-02-02 19:00:35.741000+00:00,"Hello Robbie, I have looked the conversation up and see our colleague Anneke has apologised for any unintended bluntness in her messages. With English not being our first language, this can happen, but it is not intended that way. I'm sorry to hear you are unhappy with the promised giftcard because it was a lower amount then the other giftcards.  Hopefully you will be able to enjoy them anyway.

57,Devesh Chaturvedi,30,GB,1,Worst customer service with employees with big attitude problem,This evening a few of us went to buy gifts for our families after a holiday in the Netherlands before going back home in various parts of the globe. One of the sales associates was extremely rude and probably lacked basic customer services skills. I spoke with the manager and he was even worse. The associate became even more rude in front of the manager and he was looking clueless. Realising poor customer service and no respect are the values this store runs on I left as I don’t live in AMS and there are plenty of options to buy. This was my last visit and any one visiting AMS stay away from this store. No wonder trust pilot rating is 2 out of 5.,2018-12-22 00:26:55+00:00,1,2018-12-28 14:00:15.474000+00:00,"Hello Devesh, I'm sorry to hear about your experience in our stores in Amsterdam.

59,Sabine Wildevuur,3,NL,1,After seven weeks of 'repair'  still nothing has happened...,"The service of the Bijenkorf is really poor. I bought an Artemide lamp for repair. After more than a month I sent an email to ask for an update. Turned out that nothing happened, the lamp was still at the warehouse! After my email they sent their apologies and told me that the lamp was sent straight away. I sent an email to request a replacement for the time of repair. No response at all. We are now 7 weeks further. I called the service desk yesterday. They tried to connect me to the people in Amsterdam without success. I was promised that my request was now with high priority and that someone of Bijenkorf Amsterdam was going to call me back that same day. Still nothing. I would really appreciate it when Bijenkorf will contact me to settle this issue once and for all.
